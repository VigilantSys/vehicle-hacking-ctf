# Analyzing PNG image

## The .png file shows a stackoverflow post. One of the answers mentions that the arbitration ID is 1d4

# Analyzing CAN traffic

## You can run cansniffer -c vcan0 to view the traffic
## There is a message with the mentioned ID in the traffic
## All the data is changing except for the 3rd byte
## An unlock command is unlikely to be changing frequently so this is the most likely location
## One way to implement lock/unlock might logically be a boolean value (0 or 1)

# Sending the unlock command

## cansend can be used to test our theory
cansend vcan0 1d4#0000010000000000
